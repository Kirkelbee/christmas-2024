    <h2> 2014 : The first Christmas</h2>
    <p>We were very busy with our series of firsts.</p>

    <div>
        <img class="left" src="./images/2014 IMG_2082.JPG" alt="philipolis">
        <p>We made our way down to Sedgefield via Philippolis 
            where we discovered the Boer war remained in progress,
            the last of the Bittereinders (our host) holding out 
            by trying to promote Afrikaans businesses over English ones!</p>

        <img class="right" src="./images/2014 IMG_2097.JPG" alt="cake">
        <p>I introduced you all to my family's famous Christmas cakes! I think our 
            10 year streak ended this year when we couldn't travel through PMB to 
            collect!</p>

        <p>You took me to Gericke's which has become something of a favourite place. 
            No trip to Sedgefield is complete without a climb to the point and a swim 
            in the tranquil pools below.

        <img class="right" src="./images/2014 IMG_2228.JPG" alt="gerickes">
        <p>We made our first trip to Oudshoorn together, seeking sunshine 
            after too many cloudy days! We visited the amazing Cango Caves
        </p>

        <p>We finished up at Woodridge. Just yesterday Joel was talking about fetching 
            the braai on the school bakkie, and I reminded him how Simon and I saved that 
            wet wood fire in style!
